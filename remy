      <div class="six columns">  
      <p>A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him.The Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much injured tone:<br>
"You have no right to take my property like that!"<br>
The Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said:<br>
"Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?"</p>

      <h2>The Stag And His Reflection</h2>
      </div>
        
      <div class="six columns">
      <p>A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.<br>
"How can it be," he sighed, "that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown."<br>
At that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him. Then the Stag perceived that the legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not been for the useless ornaments on his head.</p>

      <h2>The Bear And The Bees</h2>
      </div>
        
      <div class="six columns">
      <p>A Bear roaming the woods in search of berries happened on a fallen tree in which a swarm of Bees had stored their honey. The Bear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out if the Bees were at home. Just then one of the swarm came home from the clover field with a load of sweets. Guessing what the Bear was after, the Bee flew at him, stung him sharply and then disappeared into the hollow log.<br> The Bear lost his temper in an instant, and sprang upon the log tooth and claw, to destroy the nest. But this only brought out the whole swarm. The poor Bear had to take to his heels, and he was able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water.</p>
